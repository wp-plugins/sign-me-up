Add a simple straightforward sign-up form to your WordPress site. Integrates with phpList, the most popular open-source newsletter manager.


== Description ==

= Sign Me Up =

This plugin is a widget that adds a simple sign-up form to your WordPress site, allowing visitors to subscribe to your mailing list. It serves as a front end to [phpList](http://www.phplist.com), the most popular open-source newsletter manager (over 1.5 million downloads according to their website). The widget connects to phpList via AJAX, which allows a visitor to subscribe without leaving your WordPress page - no refresh or redirect is necessary. 

**Features:**

* Add a simple "sign-up to our newsletter" form to your WordPress site
* Provides a back-end connection to the powerful open-source mailing list manager, phpList 
* Maintains the consistent look, feel, and branding of your WordPress site
* Uses AJAX – no page refresh or redirects. Status & feedback are displayed on the same page as the form
* Minimal, elegant, simple. Seamlessly blends in with your theme by incorporating existing styling rules
* Easy customization – change the text of each form element so it says exactly what you want
* Widgetized – easily add it to your site via drag & drop
* Error checking – client side validation via popular jQuery Validation library provides immediate feedback to the user and reduces erroneous data

== Installation ==

**Requirements:**

* phpList version 3.0.10 or greater (either self-hosted or hosted)
* WordPress version 4.0.1 or greater


**To install this plugin:**

1. Upload the contents of sign-me-up.zip to your plugins directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the Sign Me Up widget to your site using the Appearance -> Widgets menu.
1. Specify your form settings in the widget. For more info head over to: [Sign Me Up](http://www.jaromy.net/wordpress-plugins/sign-me-up/)
1. If phpList and WordPress are on separate domains or subdomains, then you will need to modify the .htaccess file on the phpList domain. See [Cross-Domains](http://www.jaromy.net/wordpress-plugins/sign-me-up/#cross-domains) for more details.
1. That's all. You're done!

Alternatively you can search for the plugin from your WordPress dashboard and install from there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to use phpList? =

Yes, this plugin specifically designed to use phpList as the mailing list manager to store the email adresses

= Will it work with other mailing list services such as MailChimp? =

No, this plugin will not work with MailChimp or other mailing list services. It is designed as a free open-source alternative to these paid services. So, instead it works with phpList.

= Can I add additional fields for the user to fill out, such as Name? =

Unfortunately, no. Currently there is no provision in the AJAX code in phpList to parse these additional parameters. As a workaround,
it is possible to request for these fields (Name, Zip Code, etc) in any of the confirmation emails sent by phpList, or have
the user update their profile with these additional details.

= Can I use more than one Sign Me Up widget? =
 
You can only have one widget per WordPress page. But, you can setup multiple widgets that each reside on a different page of your website. For example, one widget on the "Contact Us" page, a different widget on the "Latest News" page, etc. This allows you to customize the message of the signup form to whatever content you are displaying on that page.

= How do I customize the response message? =

The messages for a successful response can be customized via the Subscribe Page in phpList. Unfortunately, the error messages and failed submission messages cannot be customized.

= Can I use the hosted version of phpList? =

Yes, this should work with no issues. Just make sure that you enable cross-domain AJAX first. For more detailed instructions, see [Cross-Domains](http://www.jaromy.net/wordpress-plugins/sign-me-up/#cross-domains).

= Can phpList and WordPress live on different domains or subdomains? =

Yes. Again, just make sure that you have enabled cross-domain AJAX. For more detailed instructions, see [Cross-Domains](http://www.jaromy.net/wordpress-plugins/sign-me-up/#cross-domains).

= I get the following error: "Unfortunately a network error occurred. Please try again. If this problem persists, please contact the webmaster." =

This could be due to a number of issues:

* Cross-domain issues, see [Cross-Domains](http://www.jaromy.net/wordpress-plugins/sign-me-up/#cross-domains)
* WWW-prefix issues, see [WWW-prefix](http://www.jaromy.net/wordpress-plugins/sign-me-up/#cross-domains)
* Old incompatible versions of phpList or WordPress, see [Requirements](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sign-me-up/installation/)
